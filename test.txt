[Jamaal:] [outside the Rookery talking to teammates] OK guys, these eggs have given us a lot of trouble in the past, uh… does anybody need anything off this guy or can we bypass him?
[Ritter:] Uhh, I think Leeroy needs something from this guy
[Jamaal:] Oh, he needs those Devout Shoulders? Doesn’t – isn’t he a paladin?
[Ritter:] Yeah… but that will help him heal better. I have more mana.
[Jamaal:] [sighs] Christ. OK, uhh well what we’ll do, I’ll run in first, uh…gather up all the eggs. We can kinda just, ya know, blast them all down with AOE. Um, I will use Intimidating Shout to kinda scatter ’em, so we don’t have to fight a whole bunch of them at once. Uhh… when my Shouts are done, I’ll need Anfrony to come in and drop his Shout too, uh… so we can keep them scattered and not to fight too many. Um… when his is done, Bas of course will need to run in and do the same thing. Uh…we’re gonna need Divine Intervention on our mages, uhh so they can AE, uh so we can of course get them down fast, ’cause we’re bringing all these guys. I mean, we’ll be in trouble if we take them down quick. Uhh, I think this is a pretty good plan, we should be able to pull it off this time. Uhh, what do you think Abduhl? Can you give me a number crunch real quick?
[Abduhl:]] Uhhh.. yeah, gimme a sec… I’m coming up with thirty-two point three three uh, repeating of course, percentage, of survival.
[Jamaal:] Uh…that’s a lot better than we usually do. Uhh, alright, you think we’re ready guys? [interrupted]
[Leeroy:] Alright chums, (I’m back)! Let’s do this… LEEROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOY JEEEEEENKIIIIIIIIIIINS! [runs into Rookery]
[Forekin:] [incredulous] … Oh my God he just ran in. [runs in]
[Ritter:] Save him!
[Jamaal:] Oh jeez, stick to the plan.
[Forekin:] Oh jeez, let’s go, let’s go! [follows]
[Abduhl:] [laughing] Stick to the plan chums!
[Jamaal:] Stick to the plan!
[Forekin:] Oh jeez, oh fuck.
[Therien:] Gimme a Divine Intervention, hurry up.
[Jamaal:] Shoutin’!
[Therien:] It’s saying I can’t cast! I can’t move, am I lagging, guys?
[Spiffy:] I can’t move!
[Forekin:] What the – what the hell?
[Spiffy:] I can’t AE!
[Forekin:] Oh my God…
[Abduhl:] The eggs just keep respawning! More respawning!!
[Forekin:] I don’t think you can cast with that shit on!
[Spiffy:] Oh my God!
[Leeroy:] We got em, we got em!
[Basphemy:] I got it! I got it! [muffled shouts]
[Spiffy:] Take it off! Take it off! [muffled shouts]
[Jamaal:] Jamaal’s down. Jamaal’s down.
[Forekin:] Oh my God..
[Jamaal:] Goddamit Leeroy!
[Forekin:] Goddamit…
[Abduhl:] Leeroy, you moron! [various other put-downs of Leeroy amongst group]
[Ritter:] I’m on it.
[Basphemy:] It’s on Bas.
[Jamaal:] Listen, this is ridiculous.
[Unknown:] You d*****s!
[Forekin:] I’m down, Forekin down. Goddamit. [shouting, then a pause, followed by other put-downs]
[Basphemy:] Bas is down.
[Abduhl:] This is the (drowned out)th time we’ve died on this, God!
[Abduhl:] Spiffy, rez us! Spiffy, rez us!
[Jamaal:] Why do you do this shit, Leeroy?
[Spiffy:] I’m trying!
[Leeroy:] [cries] It’s not my fault!
[Forekin:] Who’s Soulstoned?
[Jamaal:] We do have a Soulstone up, don’t we? [everyone dies] Think I need a Soulstone?
[Abduhl:] Yeah but I don’t think we brought a Warlock.
[Forekin:] [noticing everybody is dead] … Oh God…
[Jamaal:] Oh for – [sighs, nearly chokes and swallows] Great job!
[Unknown:] For Christ’s sake! [indistinguishable]
[Abduhl:] Leeroy, you are just stupid as hell.
[Spiffy:] Nimrod.
[[Another Player:] Oh my God…
[Leeroy:] … At least I have chicken.
